An Ottendorf cypher contains a series of numbers referencing a sentence, word,
and letter in a text.  

For example: 1, 2, 3

(1 = The first sentence in the text) - The first number references which number
sentence to look at.

The second number references the word in the sentence (2 = 2nd word in the sentence).

The third number references the letter in that word that was just found
(3 = 3rd letter in the word).

These ciphers usually consist of three numbers separated by commas. The goal of the
cipher is to reveal a hidden word or phrase by combining the found letters together.

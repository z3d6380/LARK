Modular Arithmetic:

Modular mathematics is very similar to basic division concepts that we learned
as children, however it comes with a bit of twist in syntax. The equation used
for modular math when dividing two numbers looks as follows:

(A/B) = Q modulo R.

A is the dividend.
B is the divisor.
Q is the quotient.
R is the remainder.

In terms of normal division equations, the above modular equation is equal to:

	_Q_  remainder R.
      A| B

questions using modular arithmetic.

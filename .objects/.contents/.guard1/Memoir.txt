"To the Ones We Left Behind"

December 1, 1991,
It had to be done.  I had to activate the nuclear launch sequence.  The CIA had
been hot on my trail, and what's worse is that I fear that my own daughter is
the operative chasing me down.  For a moment I considered abandoning the idea of
all this destruction for my daughter, but alas, my love for Mother Russia is too
strong.. even at the cost of my own life, Mother Russia should rise like a phoenix.
This may be my last entry.

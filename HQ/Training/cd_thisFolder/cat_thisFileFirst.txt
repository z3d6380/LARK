Cadet,

Looks like the training is going well. Being here means
that you've learned the following Linux Commands:

1) Using 'ls' or 'ls -F' to look around
2) Using 'cd {locationName}' to move into another location
3) Using 'cat {fileName}' to read a file

You've also learned that you have a journal that you can read
with 'journal -r' or write to with 'journal -w'.

Although mentioned in the journal, we think it is important to
stress that you understand how to interact with objects.

First, when you issue the 'ls -F' command, you will see interactive
objects with a '*' at the end of the name.  When you see objects
like that, you can interact with them in the following ways:

1) 'source ./{fileName} -option' Linux command for sourcing scripts
2) '. ./{fileName} -option' Linux command for sourcing scripts
3) 'open ./{fileName} -option' Game command
4) 'use ./{fileName} -option' Game command

To complete this training we need you to interact with an object
that will unlock your first mission back in HQ.  Once you run it,
you will need to 'cd' back to HQ.  Remember that 'cd ..' will do
so, and that the '..' is an alias for "parent directory".

Now go and interact with the object in this room named 'Graduation':

'. ./Graduation -a'

-HQ

Cadet,

Your journal has been updated with instructions
that will bring you success in your training and
on your missions. When you are finished reading
the rest of this message, press (q). To access
your journal, enter the following command:

'journal -r'

Your journal can be read at any time with
that command, and will be needed to complete
your training.

Once you complete your training, you can move
to your previous location using the following
command:

'cd ..'

Issuing that command from this training complex
will bring you back to HQ, and from there you can
move ('cd') on to your first mission as an
elite agent of the CIA.

Good Luck,

-HQ

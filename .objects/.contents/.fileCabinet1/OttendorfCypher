An Ottendorf cypher contains a series of numbers referencing a sentence, word, and letter in a text (1 = The first sentence in the text). THe first number references which number sentence to look at. The second number references the word in the sentence (2 = 2nd word in the sentence). The third number references the letter in that word that was just found (3 = 3rd letter in the word). These ciphers usually consist of three numbers separated by commas. The goal of the cypher is to reveal a hidden word or phrase by combining the found letters together.

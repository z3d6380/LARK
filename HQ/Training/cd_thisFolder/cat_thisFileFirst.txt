Cadet,

Looks like the training is going well. Being here means
that you've learned the following Linux Commands:

1) Using 'ls' or 'ls -F' to look around
2) Using 'cd {locationName}' to move into another location
3) Using 'cat {fileName}' to read a file
	Note: use 'cat fileName | less' when trying to view larger files
	      The pipe (|) passes the output of 'cat' into 'less'.
	      'less' is a utility to see things one page at a time

Also, if you need to save your progress and quit, remember from your
journal that you can use 'abortMission'.

One final note, you use 'man {command}' to lookup the full manual
of any Linux command you learn.  This will not work for game commands.

Now go and open the 2nd text file in this room with the vim
text editor by issuing the following command:

'vim vim_thisFileSecond.txt'

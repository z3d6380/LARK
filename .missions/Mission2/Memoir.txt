"Origins"

I was but a young man, in his prime, living under the pressures of the communist
regime in Stalingrad. Living in the bloodied city where my many Brothers fell,
by both Nazi and Russian lead. Dark times were among Big Brother and I as we
stormed our treasured city, fighting, dying to protect it. Unforgettable
tragedies consuming the mind of my Bratstvo, my brotherhood, my family. For six
long months, we remembered who and why we were fighting an unforgiving battle.
Now that years had passed, the land that is Mother Russia has risen to glorious
heights due to the sacrifices we have made; the foundation of hundreds of thousands
of bodies . My only regret being, no one will remember why we have risen to be such
a mighty force.

Cadet,

Great job on opening this file with the vim text editor.  We
think it appropriate to provide you with an explanation on
using vim in its different modes.

Currently you are in "Normal" mode.  You'll notice that you
can't type just yet, but that you can move your cursor around.

While in "Normal" mode, you can make single character changes,
such as deleting a character.  Deleting characters in "Normal"
mode can be done by moving your cursor over the character and
pressing 'x'.

Try it here-> DELETE ME

If you want to have the full range of editing capabilities in vim,
you'll have to enter "Insert" mode.  To enter "Insert" mode,
press 'i' while you're in "Normal" mode, then towards the bottom
left corner of vim you will see "-- INSERT --", letting you know
that you can begin making changes to a file.

To save your changes made in "Insert" mode, you must press 'Esc'
back into "Normal" mode, then you can do one of the following:
1) Type ':wq!' to write and quit the file
2) Press '[Shift]ZZ' to write and quit the file

To discard your changes, switch from "Insert" to "Normal" mode,
then just type ':q!' to quit the file without writing changes.

That's what you need to know to get started with vim, but please
continue reading further.

Aside from 'ls', 'cd', 'cat', and 'vim', you've also learned that
you have a journal that you can read with 'journal -r' or
write to with 'journal -w'.

Although mentioned in the journal, we think it is important to
stress that you understand how to interact with objects.

First, when you issue the 'ls -F' command, you will see interactive
objects with a '*' at the end of the name.  When you see objects
like that, you can interact with them in the following ways:

1) 'source ./{fileName} -option' Linux command for sourcing scripts
2) '. ./{fileName} -option' Linux command for sourcing scripts
3) 'open ./{fileName} -option' Game command
4) 'use ./{fileName} -option' Game command

To complete this training we need you to interact with an object
that will unlock your first mission back in HQ.  Once you run it,
you will need to 'cd' back to HQ.  Since you are two directories away
from HQ, you will need to use 'cd ../../' to go back. And since you
might be wondering, the '..' is an alias for "parent directory".

Now go take a look at the end of this file. It appears to have been
corrupted.  See if you can remove the corruption while in "Normal"
mode, so that you can reveal how to interact with the Graduation
object in this room.

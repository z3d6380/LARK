Agent Ryann,

We've intercepted the following cryptic message from Boreas.
It was addressed to Mikhail Gorbachev.

"""
1690 Mod 89 =
1495 Mod 88 =
4255 Mod 76 =
2639 Mod 165 = 

The Numbers Shall Reveal Their Secrets!

"""

We believe Boreas was trying to communicate the IP of the
Nuclear Launch computer... Decipher that message and
determine the right combination.

With that you should be able to 'ping' the IP to determine
if it is active, and once you find the active IP, you can
use 'traceroute' to find the city Boreas is located in.

Good luck.

"A Father's Pride"

Becoming a father was the proudest moment of my life. I just always found it
unfortunate that such a young, innocent soul, like many others, was born into
one of the darkest periods in modern history, the Cold War. Under the eye of
the Russian government, my life felt like a rat trapped in maze. Nowhere to go,
no end in sight, and no hope for a reward when it is all over. I had found that
goal, that reward, in my daughter's eyes. it drove me to find my purpose as an
officer, to leave the best life for her and protect her at all costs. Much like
my allegiance to Mother Russia. I kept wondering if that balance will become my
downfall, surely enough, it would.

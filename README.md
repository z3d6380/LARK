# 1991: Red Winter

1991: Red Winter is a mystery-driven, intelligence-based game full of history, myths, and secrets.
You play as Agent Cleopatra Ryann, a CIA Hacker determined to stop the plans of the USSR during the Cold War.
As Agent Ryann, you must learn the commands of a new Operating System, Linux, to spoil the plans of Boreas, an ex-KGB Soviet fixed on reviving the USSR and making it the largest superpower in the world.
Learn quick and think fast, the outcome of the Cold War and the fate of the world depend on you!

# Compatibility

- Any Linux/Unix Distro
- MacOS
- Windows 10 (With WSL2 installed, tested with Ubuntu)

# Running the Game
1. Unzip the redWinter-{verion}.tgz file to any directory with write permissions by typing 'tar -xzpvf redWinter-{version}.tgz' followed by the pathname of the directory to extract it to.
2. Then, navigate to the directory that contains the game and type '. ./startMission' or 'source ./startMission'

# Easy and Hard Mode
Throughout the game, there will be some commands where you have an option to type either a user-friendly, abstracted version of the command or the real command used in Unix and Linux. Your choice of which command to use makes no difference in the game, but it is recommended to practice using the Linux commands in order to best learn how to use the Linux shell.

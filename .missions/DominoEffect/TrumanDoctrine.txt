Truman Doctrine:

Harry S. Truman was the 33rd President of the United States, taking the seat
after President Franklin Roosevelt. Overseeing the aforementioned Berlin Airlift,
President Truman was aware of the intentions of the Communists. In 1947, Truman
created the Truman Doctrine, a foreign policy to prevent the Soviets from expanding
their regime unto the rest of the world. For decades, this document represented the
foundations of American Foreign Policy for the cold war. It also led to the creation
of NATO and the CIA. Harry Truman created the CIA when he signed the National Security
Act of 1947. Its primary purpose: to create a clearinghouse for foreign policy
intelligence and analysis. The Doctrine was a very important document that was created
at the perfect time to aid the United States in the Cold War.

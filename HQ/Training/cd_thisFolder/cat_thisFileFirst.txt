Cadet,

Looks like the training is going well. Being here means
that you've learned the following Linux Commands:

1) Using 'ls' or 'ls -F' to look around
2) Using 'cd {locationName}' to move into another location
3) Using 'cat {fileName}' to read a file

Now go and open the 2nd text file in this room with the vim
text editor by issuing the following command:

'vim vim_thisFileSecond.txt'

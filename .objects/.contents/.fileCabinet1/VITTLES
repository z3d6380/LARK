Operation VITTLES:
In the late 1940's, the capital city of Germany, Berlin, was divided into two zones,
East and West, controlled by the United States and the USSR respectively. The zones
were a proxy state to display the economies of the two powers. The Berlin Airlift
was a supply operation to those in West Berlin to deliver fuel, food, and other goods
to the population. The idea behind the operation was to prove to the world that the
Democratic system was economically and morally correct compared to the Communist views
of the USSR. This major event furthered tensions between the two powers as time went
on in the Cold War.

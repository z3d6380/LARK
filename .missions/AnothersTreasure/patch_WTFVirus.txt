Agent Ryann,

Our Data Security Analysts were able to reverse engineer the WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot
virus from the data you gathered with a previously corrupted file.

They've determined that the following tool is best for restoring the files:

''' cat corruptedFile | grep [^a-zA-Z0-9] >> restoredFile '''

There are two files here that seem corrupted, and we're not sure if they also need to
be put back in a specific order.  We need your skills to do so.

Finally, we need you to enter into your journal the line count of the restored
file for further analysis.

''' cat restoredFile | wc -l '''

Good luck.

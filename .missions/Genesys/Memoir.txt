"Dark Descent"

December 01, 1965. This was the day that she was taken. My own family had been
broken apart by my conviction to the power of the motherland. She had left me
because I had become drunk on protecting the country more than my own offspring.
Tearing me apart, piece by piece. Unsure of what to do. My wife had left a note
to me that she was secretly leaving the country to find a better life for our
daughter in the United States. Our arch rivals for nearly two decades, she had
betrayed my country, our family, and me. With that balance between my country
and my family now torn, I can only focus on my work. I had hit a dark descent
which I may still be alling. To take revenge on the United States, and her,
Boreas' fury begins now...

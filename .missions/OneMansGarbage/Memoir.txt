"State of Emergency"

In 1954, the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (KGB) was created to maintain
soviet security around the world. For my sake, as well as my wife's, I was among
the first recruits for the agency. Being a common soldier got me nowhere
prosperous, just a shanty farm in the middle of a wasteland. Big Brother had
passed away the year prior, only to be presented by Premier Khrushchev, who
condemned the actions and words of Big Brother. To think, he served in the military
under Stalin. His words would have condemned him to death. Some would say that is
cowardice, we'd call it survival. The KGB offered me a home grander than any soldier
could have ever imagined under the Communist regime. Life under Premier Khrushchev
was vastly more flourishing to my family and I than under Stalin. This dignified my
allegiance to the Soviet way, no matter the circumstances we will be faced with.
This was the best path for those I love.
